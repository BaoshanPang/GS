This repo is to show how to add kotlin code into a pure java project under '2025 WPILib VS Code'

The orginal code comes from 'wpilib: creaete a new project -> example project -> start guide'

After build(./gradlew build), you can use this command to test it under simulation:
./gradlew simulateJava
